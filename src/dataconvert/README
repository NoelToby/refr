---------------------------------------

This directory provides tools to convert from various n-best list data formats
to the protocol buffer format used by the reranker learning algorithms.

mt_nbest_proto: convert from Philipp's n-best list format (along with system
scores) to proto-buffer features.
Example converting MT data:
./lm-confusion/dataconvert/mt_nbest_proto \
  -f /export/ws11/cslmmtsr/Workshop/de-en/jhu/parallel0.pb.1000best.gz.split-a* \
  -r /export/ws11/cslmmtsr/Workshop/de-en/data-jackknife/parallel.wo9.en \
  -C -o mtsample_proto.gz

asr_nbest_proto: convert from Brian's input file format for scores, losses, features, etc. to proto-buffer features.
Example converting ASR format data:
./lm-confusion/dataconvert/asr_nbest_proto \
  -r /export/ws11/cslmmtsr/broark/CTS.refs/18.swb.ref.gz \
  -l /export/ws11/cslmmtsr/broark/CTS.100bests/18.swb.100best.loss.gz \
  -b /export/ws11/cslmmtsr/broarkCTS.100bests/18.swb.100best.base.gz \
  -t /export/ws11/cslmmtsr/broarkCTS.100bests/18.swb.100best.text.gz \
  -f 3g:/export/ws11/cslmmtsr/broark/CTS.extraftr/18.swb.100best.3gram.gz \
  -f rk:/export/ws11/cslmmtsr/broarkCTS.extraftr/18.swb.100best.rankbin.gz \
  -f rklt:/export/ws11/cslmmtsr/broarkCTS.extraftr/18.swb.100best.rankLTbin.gz \
  -o /mnt/data/kbhall/CTS.100best.18.swb.FULL.proto.gz 

(non-obvious) Options for the above:
  -U - Output files in uncompressed form
  -B - Assume the loss file is in the sentence-level BLEU format
  -A - Assume the reference is in ASR format.
