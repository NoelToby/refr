Reranker Framework (ReFr)
===========================================================================

Quick Start
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
To build and install, run
	./configure ; make ; make install


Building and Installing
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Requirements:
	autoconf 2.68 or higher
	automake 1.11 or higher
Additional requirements are checked by the supplied configure script; they
comprise:
	a recent version of Python (v2.4 or higher)
	Google Protocol Buffers
	pkg-config (a requirement of Google Protocol Buffers)
Please make sure you have at least the preceding three packages installed
prior to building the ReFr.

To build the Reranker Framework package, you must first run the
supplied configure script.  Please run
	 ./configure --help
to see common options.  In particular, you can use the --prefix option
to specify the installation directory, which defaults to /usr/local.

After running ./configure with any desired options, you can build the entire
package by simply issuing the make command:
	make

Installation of the package is completed by running
	make install

Finally, there are a number of additional make targets supplied "for free"
with the GNU autoconf build system, the most useful of which is
	make clean
which cleans the build directory and
	make distclean
which cleans everything, including files auto-generated by the
configure script.
